Zen Institute Software: User Interface and Design
Design Approach:
 Intuitive Navigation: The interface will be designed for ease of use with clear menus,
icons, and workflows relevant to each user role within the Institute.
 User-Centric Design: We prioritize user experience (UX) by conducting user research
and designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the application.

Database Design:
 Design database schema to include tables for users, classes, student profiles, teacher
profiles and payments.
 Define relationships between tables (e.g., teachers to classes, students to classes,
payments to students).
 Create database using SQL or other database management systems.

Front-End Features:
 Sign-in
• Authentication: Secure sign-in functionality for admins, teachers, and students.
Role-Based Access: Different dashboards and functionalities based on the user
role (admin, teacher, student).
• Implement secure user authentication using usernames and passwords.
